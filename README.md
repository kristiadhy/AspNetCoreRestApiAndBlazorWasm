### Asp NET Core RESTful API with Clean Architecture and Blazor Web Assembly
- I used many programming best practices implementation in this project, so please take a look for yourself.
- Thanks to *Code-Maze*, I have learned a lot from their content.
- I hosted the Blazor Web Assembly project inside the Asp NET Core project, so you only need to run the API project and both the back end and front end project will be executed together.
Kindly leave a star if you have gained any advantages from this project. Thank you!
