### Asp NET Core RESTful API with Clean Architecture and Blazor Web Assembly
- I used many programming best practices implementation in this project, so please take a look for yourself.
- I have gained a great deal of knowledge from the content provided by Code-Maze. The majority of the implementations in this repository have been influenced by Code-Maze tutorials and coding style.
- I hosted the Blazor Web Assembly project inside the Asp NET Core project, so you only need to run the API project and both the back end and front end project will be executed together.

Kindly leave a star if you have gained any advantages from this project. Thank you!
